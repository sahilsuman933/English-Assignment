                    cathedral in Prague. Various religious services, coronations
                    of Czech kings and queens also took place here. The
                    cathedral is a place of burial of several patron saints
                    including St. Wenceslas and Charles IV, sovereigns, noblemen
                    and archbishops. The foundations for St. Vitus’ Cathedral
                    were laid in the tenth century. Wenceslas I, Duke of
                    Bohemia, had obtained St. Vitus’ arm, and wanted to build a
                    church to hold the relic which was very important to the
                    Christian faith.”

                    “The Charles Bridge, crossing the Vltava (Moldau) is one of
                    the town’s landmark. The laying of the foundation stone took
                    place in 1357. Only in 1870, the bridge got its current
                    name, named after King Charles IV, who was in power when the
                    bridge was built. Afore, the bridge was simply called Sand
                    Bridge or Prague Bridge. Until 1841 it was the only way to
                    cross the river and therefore the only connection between
                    the old town and the castle. Due to heavy traffic and the
                    subsequent degradation and damage, since 1978 the bridge is
                    only accessible for pedestrian anymore.The positive side
                    effect is a more relaxing experience when visiting the
                    bridge.Most people who have visited Prague at least once
                    will almost certainly be familiar with Charles Bridge.”

                    Republic, built in the 9th century. It is the most beautiful
                    castle I have ever seen . I was stunned and amazed with the
                    beauty of it and wondered that what a level of architecture
                    skills they had in the ancient days.It was very attractive.
                    Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle in the world,.
                    The castle is among the most visited tourist attractions in
                    Prague attracting over 1.8 million visitors annually.I would
                    recommend you to visit this castle when you go to prague."

                    “Czech Cubism developed between 1911 and 1914. It was a
                    contemporary development of functionalism generated by
                    architects and designers in Pragu Czech Cubism was first
                    conceal by the Modern Movement and masked by the aesthetic
                    dictates of Stalinist and post-Stalinist culture in
                    Czechoslovakia. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the
                    post modern attraction of ornamentation and decoration,
                    there came to be a rise of fascination in Czech culture and
                    its own unique forms of cubism. Pyramid and crystal forms
                    were one of the signature principles seen in Czech Cubism
                    which was incorporated in architecture, furniture, and
                    applied arts.”
